# NEXT STEPS - Poppy Idea Engine
**Updated: May 29, 2025**

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (In Order)

### 1. Seed Dynamic Prompts (5 minutes)
```bash
# The SQL file has been created: seed-dynamic-prompts.sql
```

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/eaahmigctnbqhaqptlvw
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `seed-dynamic-prompts.sql`
4. Paste and run the query
5. Verify in Table Editor that `dynamic_prompts` has 8 entries

**What this does:**
- Adds 3 system prompts for A/B testing
- Creates conversation starters
- Sets up idea enhancement prompts
- Creates the first A/B test

### 2. Run Branching Support SQL (3 minutes)
```bash
# File exists: add-branching-support.sql
```

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `add-branching-support.sql`
3. Run the query
4. Verify new columns in `ideas` table

**What this adds:**
- `branched_from_id` column for tracking idea lineage
- `branch_note` for explaining why branched
- `is_branch` boolean flag
- Functions for idea family trees

### 3. Start Using the App (30 minutes)
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Actions to take:**
1. Start a new conversation
2. Ask Poppy about any topic
3. **IMPORTANT**: After each AI response, click:
   - Thumbs up if helpful
   - Thumbs down if not helpful
   - "More feedback" for detailed rating
4. Save some ideas from the conversation
5. Continue saved ideas to test smart continuation
6. Try branching an idea with "Branch as New"

**Goal**: Generate at least 10-20 feedback entries

### 4. Check the Admin Dashboard (5 minutes)
```bash
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin
# (Must be logged in as christianbutler@hey.com or admin user)
```

**What to look for:**
- Total Feedback count increasing
- Satisfaction Rate percentage
- Recent Feedback entries appearing
- Learning Patterns (will appear after ~20 feedback entries)

### 5. Monitor the Learning Process (Ongoing)

**Check these tables in Supabase:**
- `message_feedback` - Should have your feedback entries
- `learning_patterns` - Will populate automatically after enough data
- `dynamic_prompts` - Watch performance_score change over time
- `ab_tests` - Track which prompts perform better

## 📊 Success Metrics

You'll know the system is working when:

1. **Feedback Collection Working**:
   - `message_feedback` table has 10+ entries
   - Admin dashboard shows feedback stats

2. **Learning Activated**:
   - `learning_patterns` table starts populating
   - Admin dashboard shows "Detected Learning Patterns"

3. **Improvement Visible**:
   - Dynamic prompts show different performance_scores
   - Satisfaction rate trends upward
   - A/B test results show clear winners

## 🚫 DO NOT DO THESE (Already Done!)

- ❌ Don't rebuild the feedback UI
- ❌ Don't create new admin pages
- ❌ Don't deploy database schemas (all deployed)
- ❌ Don't implement MCP servers (already built)
- ❌ Don't add monitoring (Sentry configured)
- ❌ Don't add branching UI (already in ChatInterface)
- ❌ Don't build contributor tracking (complete)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Vary Your Feedback**: Don't just click thumbs up on everything
2. **Use Tags**: In detailed feedback, select relevant tags
3. **Write Comments**: Specific suggestions help the AI learn faster
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Try confusing questions to see how AI handles them
5. **Check Patterns**: After 20+ feedbacks, check admin for emerging patterns
6. **Try Branching**: When developing ideas, use "Branch as New" for variations

## 🔄 Daily Routine (Once System Has Data)

1. **Morning**: Check admin dashboard for overnight patterns
2. **During Use**: Provide honest feedback on responses
3. **Weekly**: Review learning patterns and prompt performance
4. **Monthly**: Analyze long-term satisfaction trends

## 🎉 When to Celebrate

- First 10 feedback entries ✨
- First learning pattern detected 🧠
- First dynamic prompt improvement 📈
- Satisfaction rate increases by 5% 🎯
- A/B test shows clear winner 🏆
- First idea branch created 🌿

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If feedback isn't saving:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're logged in
- Check Supabase for RLS policies
- Look for UUID validation errors

**If admin shows no data:**
- Ensure you're using the app and clicking feedback
- Check `message_feedback` table directly in Supabase
- Verify you're logged in as admin user

**If learning patterns don't appear:**
- Need minimum 20 feedback entries
- Patterns emerge from varied feedback (not all positive)
- Check `analyze_conversation_patterns()` function in Supabase

**If branching doesn't work:**
- Ensure `add-branching-support.sql` was run
- Check for the new columns in ideas table
- Look for console errors when clicking "Branch as New"

## 🔧 Optional Performance Optimizations

Once the system is running well:

1. **Enable Vector Search Indexes**
```sql
CREATE INDEX ideas_embedding_idx ON ideas 
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);
```

2. **Add Performance Monitoring**
- Check Sentry dashboard for slow queries
- Monitor API response times
- Track vector search performance

3. **Optimize Database Queries**
- Add composite indexes for common queries
- Enable query performance insights in Supabase

Remember: **The system is built and ready. It just needs to be USED!**
