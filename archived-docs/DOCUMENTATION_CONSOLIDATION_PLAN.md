# Documentation Structure Consolidation Plan

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Root Directory (Keep Minimal)

- **README.md** - Project overview with links to detailed docs
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Developer guidelines (rename from IMPORTANT_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE.md)
- **.env.example** - Environment variables template

### 2. /docs Directory (Organized Documentation)

#### Core Documentation

- **VISION.md** ✅ (Already created - the Poppy household OS vision)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** ✅ (Already created - technical decisions)
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** (Consolidate all status files into one current version)
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** (Merge FOUNDATION.md technical parts + setup instructions)

#### Learning & Insights

- **LEARNING_INSIGHTS.md** ✅ (Already created)
- **SELF_IMPROVEMENT_SYSTEM.md** (Extract from FOUNDATION.md)

#### Guides

- **guides/AB_TESTING.md** (Consolidate both A/B testing docs)
- **guides/DEPLOYMENT.md** (Merge all deployment-related files)
- **guides/CONTRIBUTING.md** (Move from root, expand with examples)
- **guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md** (Already exists)

### Files to Archive or Delete

#### Delete (Redundant/Outdated)

- `/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (root - use docs version)
- `/docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md` (duplicate)
- `/docs/PROJECT-STATUS-MAY-30-2025.md` (outdated)
- `/AB_TESTING_CHANGES.md` (merge into guide)
- `/DEPLOY_COMMANDS.txt` (merge into deployment guide)
- `/DEPLOY_GAMIFICATION.md` (outdated/specific feature)
- `/DEPLOY_GAMIFICATION_NOW.md` (outdated/specific feature)
- `/FIX_PERMISSIONS_NOW.md` (merge into troubleshooting)
- `/docs/FOUNDATION.md` (split into other docs)
- `/docs/PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (appears to be early version)
- `/docs/NEXT-STEPS.md` (merge into PROJECT_STATUS.md)
- `/docs/TODO.md` (merge into PROJECT_STATUS.md)
- `/docs/QUICK-REFERENCE.md` (merge into DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)

#### Archive (Historical Reference)

- `/archived-docs/` (new directory)
  - Move all outdated status files here
  - Move specific deployment scripts here

### New Consolidated Documents Needed

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** (root)

   - Based on IMPORTANT_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE.md
   - Add the "keep it simple" philosophy
   - Include code style guidelines
   - Add PR process

2. **docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md**

   - Quick start instructions
   - Local development setup
   - Database setup
   - Common commands
   - Testing approach

3. **docs/guides/DEPLOYMENT.md**

   - Vercel deployment process
   - Environment variables
   - Database migrations
   - Common deployment issues
   - Rollback procedures

4. **docs/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_SYSTEM.md**
   - Extract the learning system details from FOUNDATION.md
   - How feedback collection works
   - Pattern analysis explanation
   - Dynamic prompts system
   - Admin dashboard usage

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Hierarchy** - Easy to find what you need
2. **No Redundancy** - Each topic in one place
3. **Separation of Concerns** - Vision vs. technical vs. operational
4. **Maintainable** - Clear where to update information
5. **New Developer Friendly** - Progressive disclosure of complexity

## Implementation Order

1. Create `/archived-docs/` directory
2. Move outdated files to archive
3. Create new consolidated documents
4. Update README.md with new structure/links
5. Delete redundant files
6. Update any internal documentation links
