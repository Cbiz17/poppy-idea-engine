# A/B Testing Integration Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Updated Chat Routes

- **`/api/chat/route.ts`**: Now checks for A/B test assignments and serves appropriate prompt variants
- **`/api/chat-enhanced/route.ts`**: Enhanced route also supports A/B testing with personalization

### 2. Key Features Added

- Automatic user assignment to test variants via `get_user_test_variant()`
- Tracking of impressions in `user_actions` table
- Console logging to monitor which prompts are being served
- Support for both control and variant groups

### 3. How It Works

1. When a user chats, the system checks if they're in an A/B test
2. If assigned, they get the specific prompt variant (control or variant)
3. Each impression is tracked for analysis
4. Results are aggregated in the `ab_test_results` table

## To Deploy

1. Commit these changes to git
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will automatically deploy

## To Verify It's Working

1. Check Vercel function logs for "[A/B Testing]" entries
2. Monitor the `user_actions` table in Supabase
3. View test progress in the admin dashboard
