# Improving Browser Console Debugging

**Date:** Archived Chat
**Topic:** Browser console debugging improvements and MCP server options

## Conversation

**CB:**
I ran this real quick because it made it easy. In terms of checking the browser console. I've always struggled with that. It is not easy to copy and paste out of that console, is there another way you can add air logging and tracking? Another MCP server, you can add to help you with this? I'm not sure just curious. By the way, we just started a new chat. You can check my files and the database and everything that you can to get fully up to speed on where we were within the code and what the above messages means in terms of what I'm asking because you won't know. So let's educate you on the current state of the development of the poppy-idea-engine

**Claude:**
I'll help you get up to speed on the poppy-idea-engine project and explore better logging/tracking options. Let me start by examining your files and database to understand the current state.

[Note: The conversation appears to have been cut off during Claude's investigation of the project structure and database queries]
