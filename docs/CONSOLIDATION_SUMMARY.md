# Documentation Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Cleaned Root Directory**

- Moved `PROJECT_STATUS.md` → `/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (consolidated version)
- Renamed `IMPORTANT_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE.md` → `CONTRIBUTING.md` (expanded)
- Kept only `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` in root

### 2. **Organized /docs Directory**

Main documentation now has clear structure:

- `VISION.md` - The Poppy household OS vision
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical decisions
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current status (consolidated from 3 versions)
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Setup and development
- `LEARNING_INSIGHTS.md` - Research findings
- `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_SYSTEM.md` - AI learning documentation

### 3. **Created /docs/guides Subdirectory**

Specific how-to guides:

- `AB_TESTING.md` - A/B testing guide
- `ANALYTICS.md` - Analytics documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment process (consolidated from 5+ files)

### 4. **Archived Redundant Files**

Moved to `/archived-docs/`:

- Multiple PROJECT_STATUS versions
- Old deployment files (DEPLOY\_\*.md)
- Outdated TODO and NEXT-STEPS
- FOUNDATION.md (split into focused docs)
- Various one-off instruction files

### 5. **Updated README.md**

- Clearer structure with links to all documentation
- Emphasis on R&D platform purpose
- Better quick start section
- Organized documentation links

## Benefits

1. **No More Redundancy** - Each topic in one place
2. **Clear Hierarchy** - Easy to find documentation
3. **Focused Documents** - Each file has a specific purpose
4. **Better Onboarding** - New developers can navigate easily
5. **Maintainable** - Clear where to update information

Total reduction: From ~25 documentation files to 12 well-organized documents.
