**To**: Christopher James, Digital 323  
**From**: Andrew Butler, Regional Partner Manager - Keepit  
**Re**: Keepit vs. Dropsuite Comparison  
**Date**: June 6, 2025

Dear Christopher,

Thank you for your inquiry. I understand you're evaluating backup solutions and specifically comparing Keepit with Dropsuite. 

I took a moment to learn about Digital323's foundation on Colossians 3:23 and your core values of Care, Trust, and Leadership. These principles deeply resonate with me and align perfectly with how Keepit approaches our partner relationships. Like you, we believe in working with excellence and integrity in everything we do.

As your potential partner in the Western US region, I'm excited to share why Keepit is the superior choice for Digital 323, especially given your commitment to providing clients with an excellent IT experience.

## Key Points for Digital 323

### 1. **Market Position & Stability**
- Keepit holds **4.8% market share** vs. Dropsuite's **2.6%** in SaaS backup
- Recently named **"Champion"** in Canalys Managed BDR Leadership Matrix 2025
- **Independent company** focused solely on backup, unlike Dropsuite (being absorbed into NinjaOne)

### 2. **Critical Technical Advantages**
- **100% Vendor-Independent**: We own and operate 12 datacenters globally
- **Immutable & Air-Gapped**: Your clients' data cannot be compromised by ransomware
- **"Always-Hot" Data**: Instant recovery without rehydration delays
- **Broader Application Coverage**: Including Salesforce, Dynamics 365, Azure DevOps

### 3. **Partner-First Approach**
- **100% Channel-Only Model**: We'll never compete with you for customers
- **Superior Margins**: Competitive pricing at ~â‚¬3/user/month with strong partner margins
- **No Hidden Fees**: No ingress/egress charges that eat into your profits
- **Dedicated Support**: I'm your personal Regional Partner Manager

### 4. **Why This Matters Now**
With Dropsuite's acquisition by NinjaOne:
- Feature development may stagnate during integration
- Pricing and partner programs face uncertainty
- You may be forced into the NinjaOne ecosystem
- Migration later will be more complex and costly
