# Keepit vs. Dropsuite - Quick Battle Card

## Conversation Starters & Objection Handlers

### If They Say: "We're happy with Dropsuite"
**You Say**: "I understand - Dropsuite has been a decent solution. But with their acquisition by NinjaOne closing soon, many partners are concerned about forced platform changes and uncertain pricing. Keepit offers stability with better margins and no ecosystem lock-in. Can I show you how partners are increasing profits by 30% switching to us?"

### If They Say: "Dropsuite is cheaper"
**You Say**: "Actually, when you factor in Dropsuite's archiving tier pricing and potential hidden fees, Keepit is often more profitable for partners. Plus, our 'always-hot' data means faster restores, happier clients, and fewer support tickets. Would you like to see a real profitability comparison?"

### If They Say: "Migration seems complex"
**You Say**: "That's exactly why we offer free migration assistance for your first 10 clients. Our team handles the technical heavy lifting, and most partners complete migration in under 30 days. The NinjaOne acquisition makes migrating later riskier - now's the ideal time."

### If They Say: "We need archiving features"
**You Say**: "Keepit includes comprehensive archiving at no extra cost - unlike Dropsuite's two-tier pricing. Plus, our immutable architecture exceeds most compliance requirements. What specific compliance needs do your clients have?"

## Procurement Advantage
- **NEW**: Keepit just launched on Sherweb marketplace (March 13, 2025)
- Also available through Pax8 and other distributors
- Direct partnership options available
- Ask: "Do you currently work with Sherweb or Pax8 for procurement?"

## Power Statistics
- **4.8% vs 2.6%** - Keepit's market share nearly doubles Dropsuite's
- **12 datacenters** in 6 countries vs. Dropsuite's AWS dependence
- **8 major SaaS apps** supported vs. Dropsuite's limited coverage
- **100% channel-only** vs. Dropsuite's mixed model
- **$252M acquisition** - Dropsuite's uncertain future under NinjaOne

## Unique Value Props
1. **Only vendor-neutral, independent backup** provider
2. **Blockchain-verified** data integrity
3. **Air-gapped & immutable** - true ransomware protection
4. **No ingress/egress fees** - predictable partner profits
5. **"Always-hot" data** - instant restores

## Red Flags About Dropsuite/NinjaOne
- Integration uncertainty during acquisition
- Potential forced migration to NinjaOne platform
- Feature development likely frozen
- Partner program changes probable
- Pricing model may shift

## Call-to-Action Scripts

**Discovery**: "I see Digital 323 already offers data backup and recovery services. What percentage of your MSP revenue comes from backup? I typically see established MSPs like yours double their backup revenue within 12 months of switching to Keepit."

**Urgency**: "With the NinjaOne acquisition closing in H1 2025, partners who switch now avoid the chaos and lock in better terms. Plus, with your presence in both Denver and Minneapolis, you could dominate both markets with our superior solution. When can we schedule 30 minutes to run the numbers?"

**Trial Close**: "Based on Digital 323's established MSP practice since 2010 and dual-market presence, you could be looking at an additional $100-200K in annual profit with Keepit. Should we start with a pilot program in your Denver office?"
