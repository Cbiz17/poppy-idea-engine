  - AI Learning Progress bar
  - Streak tracking
  - Level display

### 4. Optional Quick Integration:
If you want to see the stats bar immediately, add this to ChatInterface.tsx:

```typescript
// At the top with other imports:
import { UserFeedbackStats } from '@/components/feedback/UserFeedbackStats'

// In the JSX, after <ChatHeader>:
<UserFeedbackStats user={user} />
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll See:
- **Immediate**: Enhanced feedback buttons with XP tooltips
- **After first feedback**: Points animation, progress bars

The system is designed to work with minimal integration - just the import change in ChatMessage.tsx!
